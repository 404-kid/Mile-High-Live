### Mile High Live Proposal

## Project Description

  - Mile High Live is a desktop(and/or mobile?) application built for the the new and thriving music community of the Denver metro area. The application will be an interactive map of every music venue large and small in the area. Every location will be marked by a pin and once the user clicks that pin, the concerts for the next 3 days (number of days could change) will pop up. Buttons for other information will be available such as a venue description, photos, and a link to their website.

## Problem Statement

  -  As we know many of the residents of Denver are new to the state and are looking for new things to do without really knowing their new city very well. There are so many places to see music in Denver that we can live in the city for years without ever going or even hearing of some of the best venues. We also want to be able to find cool spots for casual music without having to hop in an taxi or arbitrary Google searches.  Additionally, in recent years the internet has spawned a much larger pool of great artists, it has become increasingly harder to keep up with all the music we love. Mile High Live will help users never miss a beat.

## Map the user experience

  - Frank is a new resident in Denver and wants to show his tinder date that he knows some cool spots around town. He wants to find a small intimate venue for some chill music and to not overwhelm his date. He uses Mile High Live to find the Soiled Dove - an old style cocktail bar and venue perfect for a romantic night.

  - Helen just bought a house in Globeville, a quiet Denver neighborhood that doesn't seem to have much going on. With her friends coming to see her house for the first time she wants to show them that her new neighborhood is actually pretty cool. Hayley uses Mile High Live to find Globe Hall, a great place to dance the night away to all types of music.

  - Tim is a young energetic NATIVE of Denver who needs bass in his face at least once a week. He knows Denver always has good electronic music coming through it but doesn't want to spend the time Googling every venue he can think of. There are so many he may even forget to search some. Tim hops on Mile High Live, starts at his house, and simply moves outward from there, clicking on every music venue around him until he finds a small time DJ that he has wanted to see is playing at Club Vinyl this weekend.
